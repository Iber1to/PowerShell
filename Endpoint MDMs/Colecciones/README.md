## Important Notice

Although all the files in this folder use the `.sql` extension, **they are not written in SQL language**. The files are written in **WQL (SQL for WMI Query Language)**, which is used specifically for **SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager)**.

The `.sql` extension is used **unique for Visual Studio** to recognize the files as query scripts. This extension ensures proper syntax highlighting and formatting while working in Visual Studio.

### Key Points:
- **Do not attempt to run these files as SQL queries.**
- These queries are written in **WQL** and are meant to be used within **SCCM** for managing configurations and queries.
- The `.sql` extension is purely for compatibility with **Visual Studio**.

### How to Use:
- Use these files only in the context of **SCCM WQL**.
- Do not directly execute them as SQL queries in a SQL Server environment as they will not work.

If you need to modify or use these files, ensure you understand the structure of **WQL** and its application within **SCCM**.
