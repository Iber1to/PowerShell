A Intune Proremediati√≥n remedy to add password in Bios to HP device
The outputs of the script are configured so that in the remediation report, the computers to which the password has been successfully added are shown in green
Active Password in:
    - Boot Menu
    - System Recovery
    - Network Boot
    - Acces Bios

* Note:
    If the password is blank (as it comes from the factory) it cannot be changed by WMI. Therefore, it is necessary to set a first password by hand or ask the distributor to have it already configured.
